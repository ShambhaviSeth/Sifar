# Sifar: An attempt to develop Interactive Machine Translation(IMT) System for English to Hindi Translations

## Overview

Sifar is an Interactive Machine Translation (IMT) system designed to improve English to Hindi translations. The system uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and interactive feedback mechanisms to provide more accurate and contextually appropriate translations.
The presently available machine translation systems are still far from being perfect, and to improve their performance the concept of interactive machine translation (IMT) was introduced. This paper proposes Sifar, an IMT system, which uses statistical machine translation and a bilingual corpus on which several algorithms (Word error rate, Position Independent Error Rate, Translation Error Rate, n-grams) are implemented to translate text from English to Hindi. The proposed system improves both the speed and productivity of the human translators as found through experiments.

## Contents

This repository includes two research papers detailing various aspects of the Sifar project:

1. **Paper 1: Development of English-Hindi Interactive Machine Translation**
   - **Publication:** International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Volume-9 Issue-1, October, 2019

2. **Paper 2: Sifar: An Attempt to Develop Interactive Machine Translation System for English
to Hindi**
   - **Publication:** Springer

## Project Goals

The Sifar project aims to:
- Develop an efficient and user-friendly IMT system for translating English text into Hindi.
- Incorporate real-time user feedback to enhance translation quality.
- Address specific linguistic challenges in English-Hindi translations, such as syntax, semantics, and cultural nuances.

## Future Work

Future enhancements for the Sifar project include:

**User-Friendliness Enhancements:**
- Allow human translators to add example translations to the knowledge base before starting actual translation tasks.
Conduct a thorough evaluation to understand the expectations of human translators, including reducing the effort required for input.

**System Expansion:**
- Expand the translation system to support other Indian languages beyond English to Hindi, increasing its utility and scope.
  
**Neural Network Integration:**
- Incorporate neural networks into the system to produce more fluent and accurate translations by better understanding word similarities. This is expected to enhance the overall efficiency of the Sifar system.
